# PythonApplication1
So Anyways, this is my first ever repo and I will start learning Python for about 2 months before moving on into my first projects: Alien Invaders
For anyone who dont know, im currently major in AI Engineer and I want to learn Python asap in order to keep up with the pace in today's AI Market.
Honestly, this repo will be full of dumb craps, but this is the evidence for all my efforts that I placed into this career
Also, I dont have time to customize my profile and this repo yet, so as u can see, this looks plain asf.
If you see this repo then this is our fate lol.
Be sure to contact me cause I really need a mentor and a senior to help me fix all of my shi
